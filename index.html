		<h1>Curious Questions of Poor Smeagol</h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				Sméagol lived in his cosy cave within Misty Mountains.<br>
                He had been often visited by various strangers from all over Middle-Earth.<br>
                As he was rather chatty Stoor representative, Sméagol was head over heels to be inquisitive towards every guest,<br>
                who happened to visit his cave.<br>However due to his quite lonely existence,<br>
                Sméagol had tendency to inquire odd questions on occasion.<br>

            <p>
				As Smeagol's guests, wanderers were wont to be polite to an extent...<br>
                Each of them politeness treated vastly differently.<br>
                Some were rude, some inadequate in their answers, others were silly in response,<br>
                so searching for any meaning frequently was in vain.<br>
                Neverthless, all as one men were willing to give an answer to Sméagol's questions.
